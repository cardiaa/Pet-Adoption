That is my story like a lot of other Toms .... was an outdoor cat and pretty much scoured the neighborhood for the attractive felines, eating whatever and whenever I could. Recently a nice foster family came along, they brought me inside, helped me get ready for adoption (neutered, microchipped, vaccinated, wormed, etc.), things I've never had done before. They have taken excellent care of me but they're saying that I need to find my own forever home. Let me tell you I certainly enjoy the indoor life now! I get food and water 24/7. I never have to search or scrounge for it anymore. No more digging through trash cans or climbing\u00a0 trees to get that elusive bird. Believe me outdoor life is not really a fun life, so with that being said, I am going to be an indoor cat from now on and I am very content with that! So if you're looking for a handsome, studly, black, male cat (your typical Tom), that's got a heart of gold and a serious laid-back personality (yea I went from the Alley Cat Tom to a cuddly pushover ... heck I even LOVE all the other cats that are around me) then I'm your cat! Now dogs ... I'm still trying to get used to but with time that'll come too. I really don't have too much problem with them, I'm just not as comfortable with them as I am with other cats, you know I was chased by many so it's just gonna take some time to trust them all,\u00a0but it'll happen.   \u00a0  Est.

He is approximately 5 months old and was rescued with his mother and siblings from a field on the outskirts of the city. He certainly would not have survived had he not been rescued. Curry is rambunctious and playful. Like most puppies, Curry will need a lot of training and of course, house training. He is already going out of the dog door though. We know that his mother is about 40 lbs and he is currently 29 lbs. But we do not know who the dad was or if the same dad is the father of all of the puppies (YES, that is possible!) We can only speculate on the size these pups will be and if they will all be similar in size. Curry is neutered and fully vaccinated as well as microchipped. He gets along with everyone he meets and has been great with all of the other dogs.     Curry's adoption fee is $225    This fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee.     All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.

She is nervous when meeting new people, but with time and lots of little sniffs, she will begin to warm up and welcome gentle pettings. She would do best in a calm, low-traffic home. HALO does not know if Batgirl has ever lived in a house before, so it is recommended she is set up in a smaller space when she first goes home (I.e., a bathroom, spare bedroom, etc.) where she can begin to adjust to her surroundings without being overwhelmed by a whole house/apartment to explore. Since HALO does not know if she's been around other cats or dogs, she should be slowly introduced to them once she is feeling more confident in herself and her surroundings. Once she has time to bond with the humans in the home and begins feeling more comfortable in her new space, she can venture out and explore the rest of her new home. With a little TLC and some yummy treats, Batgirl's sweet and soft-spoken personality is sure to blossom. If she sounds like she might be the purr-fect kitty for you, come on down and meet her today!

She was willing and able to be taught to trap herself. After getting a few short lessons on trapping she proceeded to trap her entire colony of over 25 cats.

I\u2019m a 5 month old little boy with the cutest white mittens (hence the name \ud83d\ude0a). My mom was found living outdoors and very pregnant. I\u2019m one of her 6 kittens! A  kind lady helped my mom and now we\u2019re all healthy, happy,  and super friendly! I\u2019m a wonderful boy. My siblings and I still need to find families of our own though. Being a kitten, I love to play with toys, my siblings and the other foster kittens and cats and of course I love to be petted and sit on your lap (my fur is so soft, it's like silk). When I want your attention, I'll come look for you and ask for a pet. I'll also sleep with you at night. I like playing with kids and adults \u2013 I really am a great kitten. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m all ready for my new forever home because I\u2019m neutered, I\u2019ve had my vaccines including rabies, I\u2019ve been dewormed AND I\u2019ve been chipped. Whew, I\u2019m all set to go to my forever family. I\u2019m still very young and I\u2019ll be lonely being an only kitty so my favorite would be to find a home with another young kitty or you could adopt one of my siblings! I could love one person or a whole family of people - I'm not picky. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been around dogs but being so young, I'll probably be fine if the dog is friendly to kitties. If you\u2019d like to have a sweet, handsome, playful addition to your family, I\u2019m your guy. I\u2019ll be waiting to hear from you!  \r\n\r\nP.S.

Snorlax was rescued from the county shelter, at risk for euthanasia and marked as \"new hope\" (rescue) only. He was surrendered to the shelter by his former owner, and the transition has been hard for this senior kitty. Snorlax is a go-slow kinda guy and so far has not invited us to have too many interactions with him. We are sure this will change once Snorlax feels safe and loved in a home environment. In the meantime, we will do our best to get to know Snorlax and help him feel secure with the routines at Home Fur Good. Snorlax has decreased kidney function and will require a renal food only diet. \r\n\r\nSnorlax recently went into a foster home, which means all of your questions about his behavior in a home can be answered! If you are looking to help a special senior cat, please call 602-971-1334 to meet Snorlax.\r\n\r\nSnorlax is listed at eight years old and weighs approximately six pounds. His adoption fee is $50. All Home Fur Good cats are spayed/neutered, microchipped, dewormed, vaccinated appropriate for their age, tested for FIV/FELV and vet checked.

Now, Remy finds himself off the streets and safe at rescue... and ready for adoption! Remy would love an indoor home with all the comforts a cat could desire. Soft beds, lap time, treats, and lots of love. Remy is a bit shy at first and will hang in the back of his kennel to check things out. He readily accepts pets and allowed all handling during his photo shoot. We don't know what this guy's past was, but we do know his future looks bright indeed!\r\n\r\nRemy is currently hanging out at the PetsMart at Tatum & Shea Blvd. in Phoenix.

Home Fur Good could not resist this cutie-patootie that they spotted at the county shelter. Serena will turn six years old in September 2022.  She is a 58-pound Pit Bull and Shar-Pei mix.  (Serena arrived at HFG at 67 pounds, with walks, playtime, jogs on RunBuddy and consistent diet, Serena got her girly figure back).  Serena has now spent an entire year in the shelter system.  She arrived at county in September 2021 and then came to Home Fur Good in December 2021.  Granted, Serena was a bit of a hot mess, a cute one, but still a hot mess.  Along with the weight loss, Serena has gained control of her allergies and no longer does she have patchy fur or open wounds.  She will need a family dedicated to watching what she eats and making sure nothing sneaks in that will cause a flare up.  Serena is curious and outgoing; she happily exits her kennel with anyone at any opportunity. She likes to explore, and she does so without hesitation. We wonder if Serena has selective hearing and prefers to pick and choose whom she listens to, or she may have legit hearing loss. Serena is a total sucker for a squeaky toy and she will entertain herself for hours with a stuffy baby.  If you are looking for a goofy girl with a bit of an independent streak, give a call to meet to Serena. The adoption fee is $225 and includes spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital.

He was surrendered to the shelter when his former owner was no longer able to financially care for him. Simon is a bit of a shy guy, who likes to hang back and watch the goings-on in the free-roam cat room. Every once in a while, he will hop out of his kennel to explore his surroundings. But in true cat form, if he sees you watching, he will hop back in his kennel like it never happened. ;-) Simon is a gentle and mellow guy who enjoys his hidey holes. He especially loves his covered bed and would appreciate one in his new forever home. Simon did well with all handling and pets for his photo shoot. He briefly interacted with the other cats in the free-roam room and did well with them. He could potentially do well with your cat(s) at home too.\r\n\r\nDoes Simon sound like your kind of cat?

FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE USE THE CONTACT INFORMATION BELOW. \r\nIt is with sadness that I\u2019m looking for a new, loving home for my beloved dog, Belmont.  He\u2019s 6 years old, weighs approximately 95 pounds, is neutered and up to date on shots.\r\nBelmont is a handsome, friendly, strong Pit Bull mix who enjoys food, treats, walks (moderate pulling on the leash), runs, and especially being chauffeured around town. He likes meeting new people and will be your loyal companion once he gets to know you. He\u2019s past the chewing stage, and doesn\u2019t mind being in a comfy crate for short periods of time.\r\nBelmont is dog-selective and prefers to be the alpha, so he needs to be with someone who does not have other dogs. Cats are probably not a good idea either (he hasn\u2019t lived with cats) as he does have a prey drive.  While walking him, it\u2019s best not to greet other dogs until you are very comfortable with Belmont and can read his signs of agitation.\r\nHe would not do well with small children since he is strong and would most likely knock them down with his weight. If you don\u2019t have other pets or small children, please consider Belmont as your new BEST FRIEND.\r\nFor more information or to meet Belmont, please email Terry at vecova@sbcglobal.net.

They were all prim and proper then, going by Sir Fetch and Lady Rover.  In the past year, all formality has been lost and now that they have endeared themselves, the nicknames are a plenty.  Sometimes there is hesitation on whether dogs are truly \u201cbonded,\u201d Fetch and Rover have proven daily they are besties for life.  Fetch is the most patient of gentle giants and he lets his little buddy rule the roost.  You can see, when Rover is causing a commotion, he will just roll his eyes and let her blow off some steam.  They both ADORE squeaky toys and it is very entertaining to watch them play tug and switch off sharing their stuffies.  Rover is a nine-pound, six-year-old Chihuahua mix and her buddy, Fetch, is a 55-pound, eight-year-old Pit Bull mix.   Fetch and Rover are both very friendly and outgoing dogs.  They are always happy to make a new human friend, and they love getting pets and attention. Fetch and Rover have even been to dog friendly patios.  They will happily follow you around to see what you are up to, and they will make wonderful companion pets.  They both walk well on a leash and love the HFG Walking Club.  Rover\u2019s ears flop in the wind as she bobs along keeping pace with Fetch and his long legs.  Fetch is the lap dog; he will sit and soak up belly rubs all day long.  Rover can be a busy little bee and she loves RunBuddy day at the shelter.  Are you ready to roll out your red carpet for these two?

She was on the New Hope list at the county shelter.  The New Hope list is for dogs in need of adoption or to be taken in by a rescue ASAP due to various issues.  One of county\u2019s concerns was that she does have a heart murmur and they were unwilling to spay her, for fear of putting her under anesthesia.  Home Fur Good took her in and had her monitored and checked closely by a veterinarian.  June was able to be spayed and she did have a lipoma removed.  A lipoma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor of fat in middle-aged or older dogs.  June will require medication to treat her heart murmur for the rest of her life.  When June first arrived at HFG, she was quite fearful and unsure of her new living situation.  In the past couple of months, she has gained confidence and has started to let her inner puppy out to play.  She shows she can still get zoomies and she has a favorite squeaky giraffe toy that she likes to take and run with.   Routine, time, and gentle actions will help June feel more comfortable in day-to-day activities.  Home Fur Good kennel techs, who work with June consistently, already see her playful side and love to share her story.  You too can see her gentle nature in her video, as she willingly chooses to crawl into a warm lap.  If you have a big heart and a need to win over a pint-size fur baby, call 602-971-1334 to meet June!

Harpo is a four-year-old, 14-pound Chihuahua mix.  One tactic with a fearful dog is to show them consistency.  Each day, when faced with the same routine, they begin to expect certain activities, and through these repeated activities they gain confidence because they know what to expect.  Harpo spent a few weeks in the home of Home Fur Good\u2019s Animal Coordinator, if you are interested in Harpo, you will get detailed information on his behavior in a home environment.  Harpo\u2019s foster home contained two small dogs, a large older dog and two cats.  Harpo was immediately friendly with the dogs.  He met the cats a couple of times on leash, and he was interested, tried to run toward them, then he would scare himself and roll over.  It took Harpo about two weeks to become comfortable with both humans in the home and allow himself to be picked up by everyone.  Harpo has a medium energy level. He likes to play with balls and stuffed toys, and he will get pretty wild throwing them around and chasing after them. He did give a little growl if the other dogs approached the toys he was playing with.  Harpo is not leash trained, but he will follow people around the house, and while outside he would follow the other dogs, so they practiced walking around with the leash on and Harpo is slowly gaining confidence.  Harpo slept in a dog crate for the first week then slept in the bedroom with everyone and the other dogs after that. He was quiet in the crate the first night, cried the second night, then was fine. During the day he was crated at first then able to stay loose in the bedroom with the other dogs.  Harpo really enjoyed the yard, he liked running around and barking with the other dogs, exploring, and sunbathing by the pool.  Harpo is working on potty training. He picked up the foster home routine really well and held it while he was crated but there were a couple of accidents at night or right after dinner. Harpo never learned how to use the dog door and he worked on learning to sit by the door when he needed to go out.  Harpo likes to be held although he almost always does a submissive roll when you go to pick him up. He really likes dog beds and cuddling in fluffy blankets.  Harpo is working on \u201csit.\u201d He learned very fast to sit before getting dinner.  Harpo is taking Trazodone, to help maintain mental balance. Harpo makes your heart melt, and you just want to will him to be happy and let his inner puppy out to play.  He needs a family that will be patient and will give him the time and space he needs to be comfortable and to let his personality shine through.  He would probably enjoy a home with another dog, as he seems to be a social learner. The adoption fee is $225 and includes spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital.

She is a three-year-old, 53-pound Pit Bull mix.  Kitty was adopted out of the county shelter in March, and then in August she was picked up as a stray and turned back in to county.  Kitty had patches of fur missing and scaly skin.  County made the decision to place Kitty on the euthanasia list.  Home Fur Good met her and fell in love.  Kitty is extremely social and outgoing, and HFG felt that Kitty probably had allergies and allergies can be treated.  HFG was right: Kitty has allergies, and they are to environmental items that will be hard to avoid.  Cotton, wool, grasses, and dust mites are just a few things that trigger her allergies.  HFG put Kitty on a Hydrolyzed Protein Diet and made sure she did not sneak any unauthorized treats.  Her Adoption Packet will contain the extensive results of her allergy test.  She has become the Go-To Girl when it is time to evaluate dogs on their behaviors with other dogs.  Kitty not only loves to make human friends, but she is also almost always open to a new doggie friend.  She loves to wrestle and get down and dirty with her buddies.  Kitty has an interesting bark; she almost mimics a parrot when she is excited.  If you want a social girlfriend, you need to visit Kitty and see if you are instant besties.

Luigi might be a bit of an escape artist.  He was found as a stray in August and returned to his owner, and then he was again found as a stray in October.  Luigi does not appear to have been properly socialized.  Lots of pet parents think that the term \u201cpuppy socialization\u201d means introducing your puppy to other dogs. But there is a lot more to it than that. In fact, socialization is the process of introducing your puppy to the whole wide world, from different types of people to places and objects they\u2019ve never seen before.  Pet parents should aim to expose their puppy to as many different positive experiences as they can.  Luigi knows to sit when asked, but he does not understand the leash.  He loves to play, but if you move a certain way, he might crouch in fear or react with a sneer.

After my walk or outdoor activity I am more than happy to just chill with my people.    I am totally housebroken, love to go for car rides with you and behave nicely in the car. I am a good listener and very treat motivated.     I will be so grateful and happy to have a second chance at life with my forever family. Up to date on vaccines, neutered and microchipped.

Three weeks after the initial meeting, Guinness was still at county searching for his forever home, so HFG brought him in to try and help with that search. He is a four-year-old, 18-pound, highly active Chihuahua mix. Guinness knows that he is handsome, and he asks that you allow him space; he is not one of those dogs that wants to constantly be picked up and snuggled. He is confident in himself, and he does not require all that assurance. With his dash of chihuahua attitude, Guinness will do best in a home with older children.  He has really begun to trust his favorite volunteers, and he will seek affection and glorious head scratches. Guinness loves the game of fetch, he goes batty for squeaky toys, and for now, playing is much more fun than dozing the day away!  Guinness was hooked the moment he was asked to join the Walking Club.  He loves to prance about town and check out all the sights and scenes.

While there, she seemed wary of new people, which did not help her on the adoption front.  Nutmeg is a three-year-old, 45-pound Pit Bull and Boxer mix.  She does have a brief moment of shyness but if you have treats or start itching her bum, she will be your bestie, quick as a blink.  She is a total lapdog and wants to soak up as much affection as she can.  If you get goofy, or squeak a toy, she will get all silly and show you her amazing zoomies.  Nutmeg is also a smarty-pants; she knows sit, paw or shake, and we think she knows down.  If Nutmeg goes to a home with children, there should only be older children. Give a call to meet your new girlfriend! The adoption fee for Nutmeg is $300, which is higher than it would be under our normal fee schedule. That is because she is one of our Guardian Angel dogs.

When people lay eyes on Blossom it is always the same comment in amazement: \u201clook at those leg muscles.\u201d  Blossom is a five-year-old Pit Bull Terrier mix, and she is 47 pounds of svelte muscle.  Blossom was turned in at the county shelter in early February.  Blossom had been placed on county\u2019s New Hope list because she tested positive for anaplasmosis, an easily treatable tick-borne illness.  The treatment just requires time for recovery, and county does not have the space to house dogs needing time to get healthy for adoption.  Blossom is very alert and sensitive to her surroundings.  Home Fur Good is working to find the key to her attention, so she is not distracted by all that is going on in the shelter environment.  Blossom has already joined the Dog-Walking Club and she proves she would love it if her workers could go faster and farther.  She is an intelligent girl; she knows sit and paw and would be open to learning more to exercise her brain too.  So far, Blossom is saying she is not ready to make any doggie friends, and that is OK.  HFG will work with her to coexist; she does not have to have dog playmates.  Blossom would excel in an active home with energetic members looking to give her tasks that exercise her body and mind.

HFG has always known that Petey is a good boy and that he has amazing potential to learn new tricks, skills, and the desired behaviors to become an amazing canine citizen.  Petey has spent two full weeks in Board and Train with George at Couth Canine.  Petey was introduced to heeling and sitting at his handler\u2019s side.  Petey loves going on walks and adventures, and by learning leash manners, his opportunity to go out and about increases tenfold.  Petey thrived with school and having a pack leader.

He is willing to listen and follow instruction for the sheer joy of a head scratch and hearing \u201cgood boy.\u201d    His forever family will need to continue to work with Petey.  A tight bond can be developed with a healthy environment of a strong pack leader and Petey.  Petey is fine making new dog friends.

Bubba is ready to become your new favorite.  Bubba was in the home of a foster for the county shelter.  He had his foster mom wrapped around his paw and she reached out for assistance from Home Fur Good.  Bubba is 80 pounds of love bug.  He was a Velcro dog to his foster mom, and she found that he was lovable and loyal towards all people, both adults and children.  Bubba is a Pit Bull mix, and he is five years old.  He has lived long enough to know he would prefer to be the only pet in his forever home.  His foster mom said that he is housebroken, and he will let you know when he needs something by barking, pacing, or scratching at a barrier.  Otherwise, he rarely barks.  He was left alone for four to five hours at a time with no issue.  Bubba was taken on two walks a day ranging from half a mile to a mile.  When he decides to pull, he will need a strong handler.  Toys with squeakers do not stand a chance around Bubba; he sure does enjoy them.  He also loves belly rubs, car rides, and being involved in all household activities.  In his past, Bubba has had multiple hematomas and ear infections.  His inner right ear is partially collapsed from this.  He does require ear cleaning every two to three days, which he tolerates with treats and affirmations.  If you are ready for a gentle, giant lapdog, call to meet Bubba.

They are 12 and ten pounds, respectively, perfect to make a little snuggly dog pile.  They have been together their whole lives, with an owner who absolutely adored them.  She could no longer care for them, so they have come to Home Fur Good in search of a new family.  Sparkletts was recently diagnosed with diabetes and requires daily insulin shots.  She has taken this event in stride and is simply happy to be feeling better.  These sisters are the quietest Chihuahuas on the block; they never got the yip yap memo!  Together they barely make one medium-sized dog; do not delay, call to meet these golden gals.

She is estimated to be eight years old.  She is a skinny gal who would look perfect with a couple more pounds added to her current 15.  Almond is being labeled as a Shiba Inu and Parson Russell Terrier mix.  It is kind of fun to watch her explore, and guess the breeds that gave her a floofy fox tail or little Shar Pei-style ears.  Almond was a stray and when a group of well-intentioned people tried to catch her, she nipped one of them. This action landed her on the euthanasia list at county.  Home Fur Good spent some time with Almond and realized she acted out of fear.  Almond doesn\u2019t have the eyesight or hearing of a young dog anymore.  These diminished senses, on top of not understanding what is going on, will put anyone in self-defense mode.  Almond also had an upper respiratory infection when she arrived, and no one is on their best behavior when they do not feel well.  Almond is slowly settling into the routines of HFG.  She loves getting out of her kennel and getting the opportunity to explore.  She is most happy being left to trot about, surveying her surroundings.

Interested adopters will be given Glinda\u2019s full scoop, but we are choosing to move forward, in this post, and focus on Glinda\u2019s future home that will love her for who she is.  Glinda so badly wants to make new friends; she just asks that you initiate the interaction.  Moving slowly, talking softly and allowing Glinda to see your intentions will make big strides in gaining her trust.  She has been with Home Fur Good for several months, she has created many fans amongst workers and volunteers.  Many people want to see her in a loving home.  All interested adopters will get honest answers about Glinda and what her perfect home will look like.  Glinda is a smart girl and will sit for you when asked.  She is working hard on becoming a full fledged member of the Dog Walking Club.  She gets nervous out and about and takes a moment to read her surroundings.  Training with Glinda would create a very strong bond and would benefit both Glinda and her new family.   If you would like the prettiest new bestie, call 602-971-1334 to meet Glinda.

Home Fur Good loves this guy, and we know his perfect family is out there that will love him just the way he is. And the way Randy \"is,\"... is a bit special! ;-) Randy has had a few failed adoptions thus far, but we all know you don't often find true love on the first try. Randy has spent quite a bit of time with our trainer, who has helped us gain some more insight into his personality. \r\n\r\nTo start, Randy is a FUN guy! He clearly has a talent for doggy modelling, and would love a forever home that takes lots and lots of pictures of his handsome face. Randy is always willing to pose with his \"sit\" and \"paw\" tricks, and will happily show them off for some treats. Randy has the perfect moderate energy level. Sometimes he enjoys a good run around the yard with a toy, and sometimes he's happy to curl up on a bed and chill out with a chew bone. Randy is affectionate with those he knows (he loves a good back scratch), but also independent enough to sniff around and explore on his own. In fact, Randy has quite the independent streak to him, which is part of what has made finding his perfect forever fit a bit of a challenge. Per Home Fur Good's trainer, Randy has quite a stubborn streak to him, and will do best in a home that sets boundaries while still allowing Randy to be Randy. He does not enjoy being \"forced\" to do things, and does not respond well to \"discipline-based\" dog training. Randy will do best in a home that loves him just the way he is, and is willing to get to know Randy on his terms. Randy will also do best in a home with no small children, and no other animals. \r\n\r\nWe KNOW Randy's perfect person is out there waiting for him... could that person be YOU? Randy is currently in board and train with Home Fur Good's trainer in Phx. Call 602-971-1334 and we will get you in touch with Randy's trainer for a meet and greet.

Dug has a doggie friend at HFG and they are left alone together in the yards and they happily go about their business together.

His owners did not have the time needed to meet the needs of puppy.  Rigby was born on January 7th, and he is a growing, 28-pound Pit Bull mix.  Rigby\u2019s owners did try to do right by him, because he has the most amazing sit and he will hold the position, looking at you intently for more direction.  Rigby is an absolute love; he enjoys making the rounds in a room full of people.  He wants to say hello to everyone and make sure they know they are welcome into his circle of friends.  Rigby is true to his puppy nature, and he can be easily distracted by shiny, or squeaky, items!  Home Fur Good has been working with Rigby on his social skills with other dogs.  He comes in hot meeting other pups, and not all pups like that approach.  Another HFG dog resident, Kitty, does not mind Rigby\u2019s style of play and she happily romps with him.  Rigby is just waiting for you to make the call to come and meet him.

{"animal": "dog", "name": "FRITO", "size": "Small 25 lbs (11 kg) or less", "gender": "Male", "breed": "Chihuahua", "location": "Home Fur Good City: Phoenix, AZ", "age": "Senior", "story": "Frito is listed as a Chihuahua mix, but he appears very heavy on the mix.  If only it were easier to determine what makes some doggos so unique!  He is eight years young and weighs a whopping seven pounds.  Frito was initially found as a stray and taken to the county shelter.  He was adopted out and returned after four days.  Frito was wearing an e-collar after a recent neuter surgery and his adopter said he snapped at them when they were adjusting the collar.  That home had children and bigger dogs. They stated he was good with the children and showed fear toward the bigger dogs.  Home Fur Good found that Frito needs to cut back on the junk food; he was given a dental exam and ended up having 16 teeth removed.  Frito is feeling better and has only shown a desire to interact with anyone who wants to. Frito must go to a home with only older kids, not very young ones. Frito will paw at his kennel door and hop into any open arms that are offered to him. The adoption fee for Frito is $300, which is higher than it would be under our normal fee schedule. That is because he is one of our Guardian Angel dogs.  Guardian Angel dogs are highly desirable adoptees, and their increased fees are used expressly to help defray costs for our rescues with special needs such as advanced medical treatment or training for behavioral issues, or for those who are with us for unusually long periods of time.  In this way the Guardian Angels directly help our other rescues!  All adoption fees include spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital.

He has had a pretty rough go searching for a forever home. He was found as a stray in July 2020 and taken to the county shelter. He was adopted in August 2020 and then returned in October 2020 for not getting along with the resident dog. Sprocket made himself a favorite at county. He was easy to leash and take in and out of his kennel. He would pull on the leash, but all his fans said that was because he was just so excited to get out on a walk and sniff, because sniffing is a job that Sprocket takes seriously. Once he settles from his initial excitement, Sprocket walks great on leash.  Home Fur Good has experienced this firsthand.  Sprocket is like a rocket on his way out of the shelter, but once he is on the sidewalk, he chills right out and enjoys every moment of the adventure.  Sprocket is affectionate with his human friends and recently did great on a little outing away from the shelter on a dog-friendly patio. Sprocket is a handsome guy with nine years of good-boy experience. He is always open to making new human friends. The hustle and bustle of shelter life is very distracting for Sprocket and your initial impression might not show how loving he really is. Take a moment to hang out for one-on-one time and you will see what a happy boy Sprocket is.  He isn\u2019t treat or toy motivated, and volunteers were struggling with enrichment activities, trying to find his motivation.  Turns out, he will do anything for affection.  It is very sweet to watch him solve a puzzle and then get ready to shower you with kisses.  Sprocket would love to meet you and show you his happy dance when you give him a booty scratch. Sprocket is currently in a foster home, but he is still looking for his permanent forever. If you would like to meet him, please call the shelter (602-971-1334) to arrange an appointment. The adoption fee is $150 and includes spaying/neutering, age-appropriate vaccinations, microchipping, and a free wellness visit at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital.

He is calm, cool and collected, he does not concern himself with minor stresses.  Wayne is well mannered; he will even offer his paw for a shake after he sits like a Good Boy.  Wayne has a very peaceful energy; he likes to sit with his people and chillax.  He is a young boy, just three years old, but he has an old soul.  He weighs 52 pounds, and he is listed as a Harrier and Shar Pei mix.  While at the county shelter, his tail was amputated due to a case of Happy Tail, which is when a dog is such a wagger that they nick the end, and it will not heal.  Wayne took a moment to learn to wag his nubbin\u2019.  Wayne\u2019s forever family is going to need to understand that Wayne will need time to decompress, become comfortable and to become secure in his forever home. This is not an overnight process. The general guideline is three days to decompress, three weeks to become comfortable and three months to become secure. Wayne has been with Home Fur Good for almost a year, and prior to that he was in the county shelter.  Wayne has been adopted, but in some cases, he was not even given three days to settle in.  He needs a family with a big heart, that will give him time to understand that he truly is home.  Wayne has shown some separation anxiety, and this is a behavior that can be addressed, but his forever family will need to be committed to working with Wayne. Wayne is an amazing boy, who loves to hang with his humans, he deserves the effort required to become the best boy he can be. Wayne would do best in a home as an only dog, and must go to a home with no cats.. He does politely coexist with other similarly tempered dogs, but in a home, he has shown he does not care to share his humans. Wayne has many good manners; he will sit when asked and he has a calm demeanor. Wayne does not have much to say and likes to sit and watch the world go by. Wayne is and will be a devoted human companion, he just needs to find those with giant hearts, patience and time to help gain back his self-confidence.

I\u2019m a very handsome 4-month-old black \u201cghost or shadow\u201d tabby. I\u2019m the kind of tabby where my outer coat is solid black, and my tabby markings are in my inner coat. You can see those faint tabby markings in the right light. So if you like black cats (black cats are considered lucky in many places in the world) that  are super cool, that\u2019s me \ud83d\ude09 So far in my life I\u2019ve been very very, lucky. My mom was rescued a few weeks before I and my siblings were born so we had the great luck of being born into a family with people big and little. We\u2019re now the sweetest & friendliest kittens you\u2019d ever want to meet. How lucky! And you and I will be very lucky when we find each other!  And if you like BIG Boys that's me too - well not yet , but soon. In the first picture, that's me in the front - the big guy!\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a very friendly kitten and I'm a talker. I like attention and I get it by asking you to love me. I play with the other kitties at my foster home and with the humans too \u2013 both big (adults) and little (kids). I\u2019ll sleep on your bed, your lap and by your side. I\u2019m always up for petting and snuggling. And I\u2019ve never met a cat toy or cat-tree I didn\u2019t like!  \r\n\r\nI\u2019m all ready for my new forever home because I\u2019m neutered, I\u2019ve had my vaccines including rabies, I\u2019ve been dewormed AND I\u2019ve been chipped. Whew, I\u2019m all set to go to my forever family. I\u2019m still very young and I\u2019ll be lonely being an only kitty (especially after having lots of kitties to play with at my foster home) so my favorite would be to find a forever family with another young kitty or you could always adopt me with one of my siblings too! I could love one person or a whole family of people - I'm not picky. I haven\u2019t been around dogs yet but being so young, I'll probably be fine if the dog is friendly to kitties.

He is looking for his fur-ever hero to adopt him. We think he is about 10-12 years old and would need a home that understands his needs. He's a very shy\u00a0senior who has probably had a tough life prior to arriving at the shelter. He was skipped over by many rescues and adopter due to his shy and defensive behavior. Justin is more of a ladies man we think and would prefer a no kid, female only home. He does not like to be picked up or put on leash so he can be a challenge. He does like to sit on his blankets and enjoy some sunshine near the window.\u00a0 Justin requires a diet that includes some lunch meat mixed into his kibble.. yep turkey needs to be included if you want him to tolerate kibble.. hot dogs work too. I am assuming his life as a stray or unkept chi chi meant he was thrown scraps and developed a taste for the people food. We know we are looking for a unicorn of an adopter but felt this kid deserves\u00a0a chance off the streets/shelter to have a real home.. He is located in Cave Creek, AZ for meet & greets. He is using potty pads and an x-pen but will go in a kennel if needed for traveling in and out of an enclosed dog run. Again.. he will not tolerate leash walking so you will need a place contained to make potty breaks better for all involved. Adoption Fee is $200.

She had some minor eye surgery to correct her lower eyelids which turned in just a bit too far. Willa is a little bit \"special.\" It's a bit hard to describe. Maybe she is a little autistic? She is just a bit different. She is very sweet, gets along with all of the other dogs and is a pleasure to be around. Willa needs a stable home where she will never again have to fear for her safety.     Like many of our rescued dogs we are not sure how well housebroken Willa is.

Willa's adoption fee is $275.00    This fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee.

All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.

He is very much a puppy still and is very playful with people and with other dogs. He is just over a year old and weighs about 9 lbs. He was surrendered by his owner because he had more energy than she remembered a puppy could have and her health was poor. She just cold not keep up with him or get him trained. He is walking on a leash and gets along with almost everyone. He is a little scared of kids upon first meeting but if they are calm and respectful, he adapts to them.   He still jumps on people (though very gently) and likes to stand on his hind legs and wave his hands (paws) at you in an act of play. He is silly at heart but very loving and attaches hard and fast to anyone who dares to love him. He would love another dog to play with but may be ok as an only dog with a yard to run in. He is also good in his crate.    Like many of our rescued dogs we are not sure how much housetraining Luka has. His owners said he was \"mostly\" trained.     Luka will require brushing and professional grooming every 6-8 weeks.     Luka's adoption fee is $450    This fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, spaying or neutering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee.     All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.    Adoption fees also allow us the ability to put funds towards the next homeless or unwanted dog in need of rescue!  If you would like to be considered to for this adoption or any of our amazing rescues, please fill out the application with the help of this link. https://www.shelterluv.com/matchme/adopt/AZST/Dog.    We review each application carefully.

She came to our rescue and showed us how resilient, amazing and brave a dog can be. She clearly had litters of puppies while in this state and living on the streets and survived through it all. She is just a little bit of a thing weighing around 10 pounds and gets around quite well in her wheelchair. She is able to move herself around without of the chair as well. She does not always know when she has to go to the bathroom so she would be very difficult to housebreak but would do well in a diaper or similar. While a paralyzed dog is not for everyone she is definitely one we feel is deserving of a loving and forever home and her care is not terribly difficult. She is very healthy and very self sufficient. She is also independent and doesn't get along with all other dogs. She gets along with many but she is very protective of her food as one could understand from her years of living on the streets. Maggie is around five years old. We know it will take a special person to take on this special girl but she will give you so much love in return. She comes with her wheelchair and we will be glad to educate anybody who has not had experience before with paralyzed dogs.     Maggies adoption fee is $175    This fee includes at least one health exam at our veterinarian while in our care, altering, all vaccinations including rabies (as permitted by age), a pre-adoption professional grooming and a microchip with lifetime membership that never will cost you a fee.     All dogs also leave with a new collar and or harness and leash as well as a gift bag which includes among other things, a starter bag of the quality kibble that is being fed at the rescue.

I am good sized for a Brittany (54 pounds) and I\u2019m all muscle. Everything that Luigi says applies to me (so check out his bio), except instead of fetching, I like to play keep away with the chuck-it ball to torment my brother.\u00a0 So, if you want me to fetch, you will have to work with me.\u00a0 Overall, even though\u00a0I am\u00a0larger, I am more of a cuddle bunny.  When we first came to our foster home, we didn\u2019t like cars because all the trips were to the vet. Now we have learned to enjoy car rides.  Fortunately, neither of us has shown a desire to dig, which is good, because with our strength we could dig to China. We are much happier just running, sniffing and chasing vermin. We have demonstrated our prey instinct a couple of times, running down and killing field rats. We don\u2019t eat them or anything, we just bring them to our foster dad to show off.  As my brother Luigi told you, we are best buddies, we like to sleep near each other, play like boys, chase\u00a0after critters, and get into trouble together.  I should say we probably aren\u2019t the best candidates for dog parks. If a little dog acts timid or runs, our prey instinct kicks in and we will chase him down.\u00a0 We probably need a lot more socializing at dog parks with the bigger dogs before being allowed to roam freely. So, if you are looking for a dog that you can just let loose at the dog park for his\u00a0exercise needs, we are not the right dogs for you.  The combined adoption fee for Luigi and me is $700 (discounted from the individual fees for two dogs) which helps offset our vetting and allows NBRAN to rescue more of these wonderful family members. If you are interested in making Mario and Luigi a part of your family, please complete the on-line application by visiting www.nbran.org. Once the application has been completed, you will be contacted by your state coordinator.\u00a0 A phone interview, home visit, and vet check will be required as part of the approval process.

Our ideal family would be with active adults with lots of Brittany or sporting dog experience, who love the outdoors and athletics.\u00a0 A home with mature, dog-savvy older teens would work also.\u00a0 My brother and I are used to going on a four-mile speed walk every morning for a warm up and then we play all day.\u00a0 We have strong prey drives, and love to chase butterflies, dragonflies,\u00a0tweety\u00a0birds, and squirrels.\u00a0 Because of our prey drive, we cannot be in a home with cats.  I love to play with my chuck-it ball.\u00a0 I am also an\u00a0excellent swimmer.\u00a0 My foster dad has a great pool and canyon area and we play outside 3-4 hours continuously every day.\u00a0 We love to play in our foster dad\u2019s pool, smell out lizards and other moving things in the fenced in canyon and just have a great time.\u00a0 Like most boys, we like to roughhouse and when we get bored, we chew anything we can find.\u00a0 We will tug you on a leash if you go slow, but love to move along at a fast clip or even a jog.  Any home we go to must have a secure, physical fence (at least 6 foot high).\u00a0 Mario and I love to jump and can clear shorter fences either from a standing position or with a running start. When we look at chain link fences we see step ladders to freedom, no matter how high, so only a privacy fence will do.\u00a0 So, what I am saying is that we need a forever home with a strong 6-foot (or higher) privacy fence and a large back yard for playtime.\u00a0 We would love a pool but can make do\u00a0with a children\u2019s wading pool.  Over the last several months we have learned to sit, kind of stay, do a high-five handshake, and swirl in circles for treats.\u00a0 We sit for cookies and chewies, and before a door is opened, and then barrel through with glee.\u00a0 We are both fast learners and respond well to training.\u00a0  After a day of exercise, we are very peaceful and full of cuddles.\u00a0 We are fully crate-trained.\u00a0 We call the crates our \u201chouse\u201d and enjoy sleeping, eating and napping in the crate with the door open or closed.\u00a0 If you close the door at night, we feel very secure and sleep through the night, if you don\u2019t close the door, when it cools off, we will sneak up and get in bed to warm you up and cuddle.\u00a0 Of course, we really want to sleep in the same room as our parent.  The combined adoption fee for Mario and me is $700 (discounted from the individual fees for two dogs) which helps offset our vetting and allows NBRAN to rescue more of these wonderful family members.\u00a0 If you are interested in making Luigi and Mario a part of your family, please complete the on-line application by visiting www.nbran.org.\u00a0 Once the application has been completed, you will be contacted by your state coordinator.\u00a0 A phone interview, home visit, and vet check will be required as part of the approval process.\u00a0 While Luigi and Mario can be transported up to 1400 miles to their new home, preference will be given to approved adopters who live closer to their foster home.

I love naps, cuddles, playing, and looking out the window. I am shy at first, but warm up quickly and will cuddle right up next to you. I might even watch a little tv with you too! And oh do I love to be petted! I would do best in a calm, quiet home, preferably with older children and adults, as I am a little nervous around loud noises and a lot of commotion. I am a healthy girl, microchipped, up to date on all my shots, and am spayed too. I get along great with the two other cats I live with. I have not been around dogs, but will probably do just fine with calm dog and a slow introduction.

Snally is also extremely cat friendly - she spends a lot of her time running around or snuggling with the other kitties in her foster home. Because of this, her foster parents would love for her forever home to have a friendly cat for her to bond with.    She is spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, and microchipped. She is about 1 year and 1 month old as of 11/2022.    Email Info@SoulAnimalShelter.org to set up a meet and greet!

Saved from the county shelter, Nikki was scheduled to be put down for being scared, untrusting, and not walking on a leash. We have no record of what her life was like prior to arriving at the animal shelter, but from what we can tell, it was a very unkind one with her possibly being a bait dog. Despite her past, Nikki is a gentle soul who doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body. She patiently allows all handling and is learning that human touch can be a good thing. We have been working on rebuilding Nikki\u2019s confidence, and this girl has been a real trooper. She dutifully follows the humans she\u2019s learned to trust, and she now walks like a pro on the leash!\r\n\r\nOur veterinarian thinks Nikki is a younger pup \u2013 around 3 years old. At 38 lbs., Nikki is a smaller girl, and our best guess is that she is a Labrador/Border Collie Mix. While she isn\u2019t a high-energy dog, Nikki LOVES to be moving and be outdoors! If you want a do-it-all hiking buddy, Nikki would love to accompany you. She doesn\u2019t pull on the leash, and calmly walks past runners, bikers, and other dogs on the trails. Nikki settles easily in the car, and would be a great candidate for van life (Exploring new places every day? That\u2019s right up her alley!). \r\n\r\nSPECIAL NOTE: While Nikki is part Labrador Retriever, it appears her lack of early socialization means she is not your typical happy-go-lucky spirit that most adopters tend to associate with labs. She is very much a project dog who needs a patient handler that is experienced in working with low-confidence dogs. An active handler is also a necessary requirement as movement activities (walks, hiking, parkour, etc.) are Nikki\u2019s love language. She simply comes alive when she is doing something active by your side!\r\n\r\nIf you give her a chance, you\u2019ll see Nikki is at heart a fun (sometimes goofy!) and curious dog that desires a connection with the world around her. Although Nikki had a rough start at life, we are certain there is a home out there that can continue to patiently polish her into the sparkling gem she was intended to be.\r\n\r\nWhile our rescue typically does not adopt out beyond Phoenix, in order to best meet Nikki\u2019s adventure needs, we will make an exception and accept applications from outside the Phoenix metro area.\r\n\r\n**$200 Adoption fee includes: vaccinations, dewormed, spay, and microchip.\r\n\r\nIF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN MEETING NIKKI, PLEASE FIRST FILL OUT AN ADOPTION APPLICATION: https://pepperspals.org/adoption-application/.

This is a breed that has very specific needs for an adoptive home.  Because of their need for a high level of exercise, both mentally and physically and their need for ongoing training, only applicants with demonstrated owner/handler experience with this breed will be considered.  The vast majority of them are not best suited as family pets, but in homes with experienced handlers knowledgeable of their needs and breed characteristics.  We will not place in homes with small children or small dogs/cats.  \r\n\r\nCiara is a very sweet lady but still has a lot of confidence building to do, especially around men. She is very unsure of new people and may take a bit to warm up. She may be particularly fearful of men but with the right home and a little patience she will come around and learn to trust. She seems to instinctively become protective around the people that she does know. She does need some work on containing her manners when she does become excited with familiar people. \r\n\r\nCiara is an energetic lady who will benefit from an active and experienced owner. She becomes very affectionate when she is comfortable with you, she will climb in your lap or sit next to you and relax once she\u2019s gotten her energy out. She has been known to become reactive to dogs but this seems to be solely fear based, she has come a long way in her reactions to other dogs and seems to become less reactive when she\u2019s with a handler she feels safe with. Overall Ciara has so much potential to be a great best friend to someone with consistent training and a lot of love.\r\n\r\nIf you can give Ciara  an indoor forever home, please fill out our online application on our website at http://www.savingpawsrescueaz.com/adoption-form/  \r\n\r\n We will only schedule meet and greets with an approved application.

Bernie is a special guy who is a volunteer favorite among many at the rescue. He has a few quirks which has caused him to be with us for quite some time. He will need a family with patience and commitment, and one who really understands the breed.\r\n\r\nBernie can be selective on the people in his friend group, so we will require that any potential adopter comes to meet Bernie multiple times to ensure it is a good fit and set Bernie up for success. Initial introductions will involve a muzzle, so please be aware of this. Once Bernie trusts you and builds a bond with you, he is an amazing, loving, happy and sweet boy. However it is important to know that in a home setting, anybody new coming into the house will need to take introductions very slow. German Shepherd experience is a requirement. \r\n\r\nGerman shepherds are known to have hip problems, and unfortunately Bernie is affected by this. In our care he has had 2 FHO (Femoral Head Ostectomy) Surgery\u2019s to correct his hips. However one of his hips never healed properly so he does have a limp on that leg from time to time. \r\n\r\nBernard is an awesome boy once you take the time to get to know him. He is smart and loves his people. He will need a home without children and would do best as an only dog.

Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements, tremors and generally uncoordinated motion. The animal often falls down and has trouble walking. To manage this condition for your pet, it is vital that you understand your pet's physical limitations. As your pet may have difficulty controlling movement, you may need to assist your pet when eating and drinking. Providing your pet with a safe environment is\u00a0essential. Due to the imbalance and wide stance, stairs and uneven ground may cause a hazard. A non-slip, flat surface, such as carpeting, is an ideal environment for your pet.*\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please visit our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or send us an email at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org\n##654651## If you have any questions or would like to adopt Ali, please reach out to the adoption group directly.

Rex is very good with kids and has spent a lot of time with babies and toddlers. He loves to play fetch and tug-o-war and likes to go for walks (he tugs on the leash but is good off-leash). Some of his favorite things are balls, balloons, and bubbles. He is neutered and had his initial vaccinations, and is waiting to get his latest vaccinations. Like any pit bull, he is very protective of his pack, but once he has been properly introduced to people, he is very loving and wants to play with his guests. Other than when he was in the shelter he has not been around other dogs, so it is unknown how he would do with them. He has not been crate trained yet, so if you plan on leaving him in one while away, he will need to become accustomed to it. Otherwise, Rex is a very loving, sweet, family-oriented dog who would love to be in a caring home with an attentive family who will play with him and give him lots of head scratches.

Penny is an awesome beautiful DMH gray girl. (She was born with one eye that isn't fully developed.) She has a quirky personality, likes to talk, and loves being on her person's lap where she gets busy making crazy biscuits and purring loudly. She will definitely be on the bed keeping you company this winter. She won't be as big as her brother Moose but she will be larger in size. She loves wrestling with her siblings, playing on the cat tower and playing with her mousy toys. She has even been introduced to walking on a harness. She gets along with cats and friendly dogs. Penny would be great for a smaller family unit; a couple or family with older children as she is still learning to be gentle when playing and making biscuits. She hopes you have other pets to play with and keep her company when you're away. She's waiting for her furever home!   DOB approx. 5/24/2022.

Cerebellar hypoplasia causes jerky movements, tremors and generally uncoordinated motion. The animal often falls down and has trouble walking. To manage this condition for your pet, it is vital that you understand your pet's physical limitations. As your pet may have difficulty controlling movement, you may need to assist your pet when eating and drinking. Providing your pet with a safe environment is\u00a0essential. Due to the imbalance and wide stance, stairs and uneven ground may cause a hazard. A non-slip, flat surface, such as carpeting, is an ideal environment for your pet.*\n\nIf you are interested in adopting or fostering, please check out our site at www.maydaypitbullrescue.org or email us at info@maydaypitbullrescue.org\n##654653## If you have any questions or would like to adopt Captain Wigglesworth (aka CW), please reach out to the adoption group directly.

Not one that any dog would like to have. Our goal is to ensure that Mia\u2019s journey ends with a forever loving home. She is so very deserving! Mia\u2019s backstory: Mia had a home earlier this year but her owner sadly passed away. She was rehomed to another gentlemen who only had her 3 days before she was on the run. A neighbor caring for his plants the day she got out asked for HARTT\u2019s help. It took approximately 10 days with sighting of her out in the desert to successfully get her safely. At the time of her trapping her new owner had gone out of town, had a stroke and a couple weeks later succumbed from the complications. Mia was homeless again.  After spending time with a HARTT volunteer a foster was found and Paws 4 A Cause took her into rescue. \r\n\r\nMia was in a foster for a short time but as she bonded with the humans her fondness of the other dogs became less. Due to this Mia came back to the HARTT volunteers house. \r\n\r\nAbout Mia: Mia is a healthy German Shepard/Husky mix. She is estimated to be ? years old. She weighs approximately XX pounds. She is spayed and up to date on her shots. Mia is a lover of all people. She is happy just to be with her people. It is recommended in her new home that any kids in the household be older. This is only due to the fact that Mia does not realize her size and can jump up when excited. Because of her bond with humans it is recommended that Mia be an only dog. She has more than enough love to give! \r\n\r\nMia is leashed trained, house trained, and dog door trained. Has a couple tricks as well such as sit, stay and shake. She would prefer not to be in a kennel and is non destructive when left to be on her own.\r\n\r\nMia would great with any single owner or family!

He LOVES to go on car rides, it's his favorite thing to do. He would be perfect for someone who travels frequently.
