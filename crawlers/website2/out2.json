From kissing and cuddling to sleeping and playing, bonded rabbits live as a pair and do everything together to ensure each other's safety and comfort. Without a companion, rabbits become lonely, depressed and anxious. So that our rabbits live their longest, healthiest and happiest lives, we have bonded them with a companion, and we only offer them for adoption in these pairs. Since bonded bunnies share the same bed, exercise pen, litter box, and food and water dishes, caring for two rabbits is just as easy as caring for one. So not only will you save two lives, but you'll also enjoy watching your two rabbits hop, play, snuggle and enjoy their new home together.

The cause of his neurological condition is unknown, and in many ways he is very much like a normal puppy. Caboodle is a happy, fun pup who loves other dogs, playing in the snow and taking a daily spin in his specially-designed cart. He has an excellent nose and enjoys doing nose work (a search and scenting sport). The biggest challenge in a home will be ensuring that he can safely move around. Also, he is not housetrained, and he can't do stairs or a doggy door. Caboodle will need to find a person or a family who can make accommodations for him while loving him just as he is.

But people only see this side of her when she's in her comfort zone beside her best dog buddy. He helps give her a lot of confidence, and she is more willing to try new things if he's with her.  Cordelia was born in 2012. She is really smart and excels at training - especially when food is involved. She's become a rock star at agility at the Sanctuary.  Because Cordelia is a very shy dog, she can be shutdown and extremely nervous when out of her comfort zone. She doesn't like being touched by people and probably never will be comfortable with that. Cordelia would do best in a relaxed, structured home with a very patient person or family who understands her personality and accepts her for who she is. A home without many visitors would be best. When there are visitors, she would be most comfortable staying in a quiet room so she won't be forced to socialize. She'll also need a confident dog buddy who will be a good role model for her.", "image": "https://cdn.rescuegroups.org/6685/pictures/animals/11242/11242321/67499722.jpg", "link": "https://bestfriends.org/adopt/adopt-our-sanctuary/11242321/cordelia"},

Although a little feisty at first, Kit loves her dog friends.  She does nose work (a fun search and scenting sport) in her room, and she loves the snow. The biggest challenge in a home will be ensuring that she can safely move around. Also, she is not housebroken and she cannot do stairs or a doggy door.

He is a typical hound when it comes to sniffing and baying.  He loves to use his nose and then tell everyone about it! Whistler is thought to have cerebellar disease which basically means he is missing part of his brain, because of this he often shows some repetitive behaviors. Whistler has done great at the sanctuary with a structured routine and relationship building with his caregivers.  He can be a sensitive boy and things like loud noises, stormy weather, and constant change can throw him off.  He really enjoys canine company.  He knows how to use his dog door, and it may help in a new home to have a similar set-up to help him with routine. Whistler loves walks and cookies and is a good learner with some patience (and cookies). He is very affectionate and sweet once he knows and trusts you.  He loves to bury his soft fur under your arm or weave between your legs for affection.  If you're interested in meeting Whistler we ask that you spend some time with him at the sanctuary to make sure it's a good fit. Whistler is a caregiver favorite and his friends would like nothing more than to see him happy in his perfect home.", "image": "https://cdn.rescuegroups.org/6685/pictures/animals/12661/12661708/63472509.jpg", "link": "https://bestfriends.org/adopt/adopt-our-sanctuary/12661708/whistler"},

Mornings are peak snuggle-time for Jessa ; if you're not a morning person already, you will be once you make her part of your family.  Don't worry though, she'll never run out of cuddles or affection for the people around her. She's generally a well-behaved girl with just enough of a naughty streak to keep you on your toes (i.e be careful about leaving food around, even if you think it's beyond her reach). She's fully house trained and continues to work on her crate skills. Grooming is generally hassle-free is you ask her nicely and make sure there's a treat in it for her. She does well in public, and while she's definitely not a dog-person, she is pretty easy on walks and doesn't bark at anyone. If you think you're ready to add additional cuddles, laughter, and love to your life, Princess Buttercup is the right dog for you. If you are interested in meeting Jessa , go to la.bestfriends.org/adopt and fill out our Dog Adoption Survey and our team will reach out to you!", "image": "https://cdn.rescuegroups.org/6685/pictures/animals/18699/18699660/91048427.jpg", "link": "https://bestfriends.org/adopt/adopt-our-sanctuary/18699660/jessa"},

{"animal": "Horse", "name": "Tony", "location": "Sanctuary (Kanab)", "breed": "Grade", "color": "Brown", "gender": "Male", "story": "Tony is a handsome and wonderful chestnut and white pinto gelding born in 2008. He has a unique history: he was rescued from an abusive pack string situation in Arizona and was part of a landmark animal cruelty court case. He was originally taken to the county animal shelter where he was nursed back to health and gelded, and now he's at Best Friends where he has continued to impress us with his great mind and exceptional good nature. He has an old injury to his stifle which makes him unable to be ridden, but he gets around great in the pasture and has a very good quality of life. He is smart, sensible, and very sweet. He needs some more handling and good life experiences, but has come a long way and is such a good boy. We are now able to trim his feet, lead him all over Horse Haven and sedate him for dental work. He is very dominant with other horses, but with a gradual (over the fence) introduction, and plenty of space, he is living very successfully with a friend. Would you like to be his friend? To know him is to love him!", "image": "https://cdn.rescuegroups.org/6685/pictures/animals/12222/12222452/55740858.jpg", "link": "https://bestfriends.org/adopt/adopt-our-sanctuary/12222452/tony"},

He's now gelded, and has been successfully living with other geldings or mares but not in a mixed herd as of yet. He is a stocky, sturdy build and is pony sized at 13.1 1/2\" hands tall. He is an extra sensitive kind of horse who is still not 100% convinced that humans are trustworthy but he's willing to entertain the idea if we go slow enough and give him time to think. He's made a lot of progress since coming here but still has a ways to go before he's a safe riding horse. He is looking for a skilled, experienced person who can appreciate all of his great qualities and massive potential but who has the knowledge and patience to bring him along at his pace.", "image": "https://cdn.rescuegroups.org/6685/pictures/animals/16452/16452625/76676888.jpg", "link": "https://bestfriends.org/adopt/adopt-our-sanctuary/16452625/byron"},

After a lot of work and time and patience, he is starting to understand how to be a confident, well-adjusted horse and show us glimpses of how awesome he is. He is so smart, loves to learn new games, and has figured out how fun it is to play with obstacles.
